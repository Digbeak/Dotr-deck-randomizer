# Dotr-deck-randomizer
A deckrandomizer for the game Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelists of the Roses, made from the deckeditor created by Blayr

# Good to know

Originally, I only made this randomizer for my own use, so it may be a bit unintuitive for others. Below is a list of things that you may want to know as you use this randomizer:

The "Randomize all decks" button randomizes and saves over all of the starter decks. 

To remove a deck, double click on it. To add a new deck, double click on a card in the trunk. 

To remove a single card, right click on it and select "Remove selected cards." To add a random card, right click on it and select "Add selected cards to deck."

It is not possible to add a specific card to the deck. 

I am pretty sure the "Less spells" checkbox does nothing. 

The fusion randomization has not been tested and should be used at your own risk. 

To add or remove a card from the banlist, simply double click on it. 

All Immortals are banned by default, except when you select "Completely random" in the dropdown menu. 

The banlist is stored in a text file in the same directory as the application. If you remove it, the application will stop working.

The "Themes" text file is part of something that was never implemented and does nothing.
